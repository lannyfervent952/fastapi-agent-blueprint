### Advanced Only: Project-Specific Highlights
Advanced users are already familiar with DDD/DI, so deliver only what differentiates this project:
- No Entity pattern -> unified with DTOs (background: ADR 004)
- Mapper class prohibited -> inline conversion (`model_dump()`, `model_validate()`)
- UseCase is optional (not mandatory, add only when needed)
- Automatic domain discovery (no Container/Bootstrap modification needed)

## 3. Recommended Skills (Workflow Order)

1. `/plan-feature` -> Feature design
2. `/new-domain` -> Domain creation
3. `/add-api` -> API addition
4. `/add-worker-task` -> Async tasks
5. `/add-cross-domain` -> Cross-domain connections
6. `/review-architecture` -> Architecture verification
7. `/security-review` -> Security audit
8. `/test-domain` -> Test generation/execution
9. `/fix-bug` -> Bug fixes
10. `/sync-guidelines` -> Guideline synchronization
11. `/migrate-domain` -> DB migration

## 4. Recommended Next Steps (by Experience Level)

### Beginner
1. Explore the entire directory structure of `src/user/` domain to understand the reference implementation
2. Create a practice domain with `/new-domain practice` to internalize the structure
3. Practice adding an API with `/add-api "add GET /items to practice"`

### Intermediate
1. Familiarize yourself with the Absolute Prohibitions in CLAUDE.md
2. Once assigned a domain, start with `/plan-feature` for design
3. Run `/review-architecture {domain}` before your first PR

### Advanced
1. Skim the ADR list in `docs/history/` to understand the context of structural decisions
2. Review `.claude/skills/_shared/project-dna.md` section 5 (DI), section 6 (Conversion Patterns)
3. Ready to start working immediately — begin with `/plan-feature`
