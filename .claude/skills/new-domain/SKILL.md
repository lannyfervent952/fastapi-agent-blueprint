# New Domain Scaffolding

Domain name: $ARGUMENTS

## Currently existing domains
!`ls -d src/*/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v _core | grep -v _apps | sed 's|src/||;s|/||' || echo "(none)"`

## Pre-check
1. Verify `$ARGUMENTS` is a valid Python identifier (lowercase, underscores allowed, hyphens prohibited)
2. Verify `src/$ARGUMENTS/` directory does not already exist -- abort if it does
3. Read Serena `architecture_conventions` memory -- confirm object roles and data flow
4. Ask the user about the domain's **key fields** (e.g., name, description, price, etc.)

## Scaffolding Procedure

Use `src/user/` as the Reference and create 6 Layers in order.
Read the corresponding user file before creating each file and replicate the pattern.

Refer to `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/scaffolding-layers.md` for the detailed file list and import paths.

**Layer order**: Domain -> Application -> Infrastructure -> Interface -> App Wiring -> Tests

Default 39 files (14 content + 22 `__init__.py` + 3 tests), with UseCase 43 files.

## Architecture Rules
Follow the "Absolute Prohibitions" and "Conversion Patterns" from CLAUDE.md.

## Verification after Completion
1. `python -c "from src.{name}.domain.dtos.{name}_dto import {Name}DTO; print('OK')"` -- verify import
2. Run pre-commit: `pre-commit run --files src/{name}/**/*.py`
3. Run tests: `pytest tests/unit/{name}/ -v`
4. Report results to the user
