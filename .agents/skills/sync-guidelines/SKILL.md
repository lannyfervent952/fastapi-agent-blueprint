# Sync Guidelines

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and `docs/ai/shared/skills/sync-guidelines.md` for the full procedure.
2. Read `docs/ai/shared/drift-checklist.md` for detailed inspection items.
3. Compare code against:
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `README.md`
   - `docs/README.ko.md`
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - `CLAUDE.md`
   - `.codex/config.toml`
   - `.codex/hooks.json`
   - `.agents/skills/`
4. Use `src/user/` as the reference domain for current patterns.
5. Report drift clearly, then update the affected docs or workflow assets.
6. After updates, re-run the inspection until major drift is gone.
